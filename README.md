# Resume Checker – AI-Based Resume Matching System

This project helps compare a candidate’s resume with a job description to estimate how well the resume matches the job role.  
It supports PDF, DOCX, and TXT resumes and uses Machine Learning (Naive Bayes) for domain prediction and TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity for match scoring.
